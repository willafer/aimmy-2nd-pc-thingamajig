Alr so i havent done this before so sorry if its ass or hard to under stand.     btw you have to use wifi. and have fastish wifi

step one get a ethernet cable and 2 computers. pls make sure they dont suck and can run a screen share AND aimmy
step two connect the pcs together with the eathernet cable
then go to network settings once your there click on change adapter options 
right click on your wifi, go to propites then shareing
check the little box that says allow other users to use this network
now sign into the same steam acc on both pcs
boom now you can stream the game from one pc to another with aimmy 
so go on steam on your pc you want aimmy on. aka the more power full one or your main than press the litte down arrow on the game launch. and select the other pc




this should greatly ruduce the risk of gettin banned
also ill just link a vid if your still confused
